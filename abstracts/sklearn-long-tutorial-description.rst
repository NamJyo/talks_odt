Machine learning is the task of extracting knowledge from data, often with the
goal to generalize to new, unseen data.  Applications of machine learning now
touch nearly every aspect of everyday life, from the face detection in our
phones and the streams of social media we consume to picking restaurants,
partners, and movies. I has also become indispensable to many empirical
sciences, from physics, astronomy and biology to social sciences.

Scikit-learn has emerged of one of the most popular toolkits for machine learning,
and is now widely used in industry and academia.
The goal of the tutorial is to enable participants to use the wide variety of
machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn on their own data sets,
for their own domains.

This tutorial will comprise an introductory morning session and an advanced
afternoon session.  The morning part of the tutorial will cover basic concepts
of machine learning, data representation and preprocessing. We will explain
different problem settings, and which algorithms to use in each. We will then
go through some simple sample applications using algorithms implemented in
Scikit-Learn, including SVMs, Random Forests, K-Means, PCA, T-SNE and others.

In the afternoon session, we will discuss setting hyper-parameters, and how to
prevent overfitting. We will go in-depth into the trade-off of model complexity
and dataset size. We will also discuss complexity of learning algorithms and
how to cope with very large datasets.  We will also go through the process of
building machine learning pipelines, consisting of feature extraction,
preprocessing and supervised learning.
