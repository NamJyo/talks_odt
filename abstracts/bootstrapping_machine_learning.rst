Machine learning applications have become pervasive in everyday life. The
modern web and mobile applications would lack much of their personalization and
interactivity without them. While the leaders in the field are giants like
amazon, facebook and google, petabytes of data and large clusters are by no
means requirements for building machine learning driven applications.

Tools have come a long way in recent years, and most datasets can be explored
and learned on interactively on a single computer, allowing everybody to apply
machine learning to their application, business or research.
While algorithms become more and more automatic, understanding datasets and
formulating goals as machine learning tasks remain challenging.

This talk will motivate the pervasive use of machine learning, argue the ease
of use of current algorithms, and give insights into challenges arising in
practice.
