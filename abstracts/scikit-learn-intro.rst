Scikit-learn has emerged as one of the most popular open source machine learning toolkits,
now widely used in academia and industry.
scikit-learn provides easy-to-use interfaces to perform advanced analysis and build powerful predictive models.
The tutorial will cover basic concepts of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning,
cross validation and model selection. We will see how to prepare data for machine learning, and go from applying
a single algorithm to building a machine learning pipeline.

I usually recommend that people install the anaconda python distribution before coming:
https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
and make sure that they are able to run the ipython notebook.

If they want to follow along, there will be material online that they can download beforehand, either here:
