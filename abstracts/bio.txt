Andreas MÃ¼ller is a lecturer at the Data Science Institute at Columbia
University and author of the O'Reilly book "Introduction to machine learning
with Python", describing a practical approach to machine learning with python
and scikit-learn. He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine
learning library, and has been co-maintaining it for several years. He is also
a Software Carpentry instructor. In the past, he worked at the NYU Center for
Data Science on open source and open science, and as Machine Learning Scientist
at Amazon.

His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine
learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access
to high-quality machine learning algorithms.

==============

Andreas Mueller finished his PhD thesis on structured prediction for image
segmentation at the Institute for Computer Science at the University of Bonn in
2013.
After working as a machine learning scientist at the Amazon Development Center
Germany in Berlin for a year, he joined the Center for Data Science at the New
York University in the end of 2014. In his position as assistant research
engineer at the Center for Data Science, he works on open source tools for
machine learning and data science.
He has been one of the core contributors and maintainer of scikit-learn, a
machine learning toolkit widely used in industry and academia, for several
years, and authored and contributed to a number of open source projects related
to machine learning.
