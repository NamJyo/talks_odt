Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python, that has become a
valuable tool for many data science practitioners.
This talk will cover some of the more advanced aspects of scikit-learn,
such as building complex machine learning pipelines, model evaluation, parameter search,
and out-of-core learning.
Apart from metrics for model evaluation, we will cover how to evaluate model
complexity, and how to tune parameters with grid search, randomized parameter search,
and what their trade-offs are. We will also cover out of core text feature processing
via feature hashing.
