Machine learning has become an indispensable tool across many areas of research and commercial applications.
From text-to-speech for your phone to detecting the Higgs boson, machine learning excells at extracting knowledge
from large amounts of data.
This talk will give a general introduction to machine learning, as well as introduce practical tools for
you to apply machine learning in your research.
We will focus on one particularly important subfield of machine learning, supervised learning. The
goal of supervised learning is to "learn" a function that maps inputs x to an output y, by using a collection
of training data consisting of input-output pairs.
We will walk through formalizing a problem as a supervised machine learning problem, creating
the necessary training data and applying and evaluating a machine learning algorithm.
The talk should give you all the necessary background to start using machine learning yourself.
