Scikit-learn has emerged as one of the most popular open source machine learning toolkits,
now widely used in academia and industry.
scikit-learn provides easy-to-use interfaces to perform advances analysis and build powerful predictive models.
This talk will cover basic concepts of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning,
cross validation and model selection, and how they map to programming concepts in scikit-learn.
The talk will demonstrate how to prepare data for machine learning, and go from applying a
single algorithm to building a machine learning pipeline.
We will cover the trade-offs of learning on large datasets, and describe some techinques
to handle larger-than-ram and streaming data on a single machine.
Finally, we will touch upon future directions for automation and promising results in meta-learning.
